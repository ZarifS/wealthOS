# Wealth-X

A new method of tracking personal finance. Data driven and a clean beautiful interface. Built using NodeJS, React-Native. Class project for CSI3140 with Andrew Forward.

## Main Idea
Create a unified user experience to give a total overview on a users financial health. Allow users to link their institutional accounts, view their balances and owings, manage their budgets and subscriptions.

## Phase 1 - Scope
### 1.1 Accounts Overview
* Allow users to connect their bank account and other institutional accounts to the application
* Gives them a overview of their depository accounts as well as their balances - net worth
### 1.2 Budget Planner
* Allows them to create a budget, split into daily intervals that updates real-time based on bank transactions
* App will allow the user to see their spending habits using categories and get insights into their spendings

## Course Goals 
For the purpose of this course I believe 1.1 will be able to be implemented fully. I do not think 1.2 will be able to be completed within just the 4 months but I can have some of the backend work done since it is usually the front end which takes the most time.
